# Ethereum Interop Layer (EIL) SDK

The **Ethereum Interoperability Layer** is a trust-minimized, account-based interop layer focused on unifying the Layer 2 (L2) experience on Ethereum. It enables seamless, trustless single-signature, cross-chain User Operations without compromising on Ethereum's core values: Censorship Resistance, Open Source, Privacy, and Security.

This SDK provides the necessary tools and libraries to integrate EIL into wallets and dApps, allowing users to execute complex multi-chain operations as if they were performing a single transaction on one unified network.

## Key Features of the EIL SDK

The EIL SDK is designed to abstract away the friction of L2 fragmentation, such as managing gas on multiple chains, bridging assets, signing numerous transactions, trusting fast bridges, confusing wrong chain addresses, configuring new chains in your wallet, etc.
